[Our team](../../people.html)'s work relies a lot on [GitHub
Actions](https://hugogruson.fr/slides/2022-03-17_github-actions/). Besides the
usual workflows to check our code for errors after each push [^1], we also have
many workflows set up to run on a schedule.

[^1]: You can visit <https://github.com/r-lib/actions> for a great list of such
    actions.

For example, we have scheduled workflow to:

-   [automatically build an ensemble forecast from weekly forecast contributed
    by teams in the European Covid-19 Forecast
    Hub](https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/blob/ba4df04e0f0454655ec1d0bd803c456cb3cf3a6d/.github/workflows/ensemble.yml)
-   [automatically build nowcasts of COVID-19 Hospital Admissions in Germany and
    the related
    documentation](https://github.com/epiforecasts/eval-germany-sp-nowcasting/blob/836fd9a8c71a085d4dd8ef1dd09168bddecef1f4/.github/workflows/build-and-publish-documentation.yaml)
-   [check that data streams in covidregionaldata are still up and
    running](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covidregionaldata/tree/master/.github/workflows)
-   [download and process weekly LFD testing data in
    England](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19.lfd.england/blob/5883ddd026d00b8f7ad066738852cac63678fad4/.github/workflows/lfd.yaml)
-   etc.

However, with time, we became frustrated because these workflows were unreliable
and [*flaky*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flaky): they were valid workflows
but were failing from time to time for seemingly random reasons. Most of the
time, just re-running them fixed the issue. In this blog post, I detail how to
limit the number of false-positive failures in your GitHub Action workflows.

For demonstration purposes, let's look at a simple workflow we might have used
before reading this blog post:

``` yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 12 * * *"

jobs:
  scheduled-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2

    - name: Install R dependencies
      run: Rscript -e 'install.packages("tidyverse")'

    - run: Rscript 'script.R'
        
    - name: Commit files
      run: |
        git config user.email "action@github.com"
        git config user.name "GitHub Actions"
        git add --all
        git commit -m "New results"
        git push 
```

# Dealing with failing workflows in the moment

## Notify the whole team when a scheduled workflow fails

While workflows set up to run on pushes or pull requests will notify the user
who committed the changes, scheduled workflows will notify the latest user who
modified this workflow, as indicated in [the official
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule):

> Notifications for scheduled workflows are sent to the user who last modified
> the cron syntax in the workflow file. For more information, see
> "[Notifications for workflow
> runs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration#notifications-for-workflow-runs)".

This behaviour is often not desirable when working collaboratively as a team on
a project. In this situation, you would like every member of team to be
notified. So that everybody can contribute to fix the issue.

There are many ways to circumvent this behaviour, such as adding a step to
notify failures on a mailing list or a slack channel [^2]. In the Epiforecasts
team, we decided to keep everything in the open and automatically open an issue
when one of our scheduled workflow is failing. This is achieved by [creating a
file named `action-issue-template.md` in your `.github` folder with the
following
content](https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/blob/c65b2b0514303834e3f072df08e44e1a03bfca9e/.github/action-issue-template.md):

[^2]: Another good approach is implemented in the [cransays
    repository](https://github.com/r-hub/cransays/blob/ed7a844f562e84857eb2d5e72ffbaab569b502ad/.github/workflows/render-dashboard.yml#L71-L80).

``` md
---
title: "{{ env.GITHUB_WORKFLOW }} GitHub Action is failing"
---

See [the action log](https://github.com/{{ env.GITHUB_ACTION_REPOSITORY }}/actions/runs/{{ env.GITHUB_RUN_ID }}) 
for more details.
```

and then appending the following instruction at the end of all your workflows:

``` yaml
    - name: Create issue about failure
      if: failure()
      uses: JasonEtco/create-an-issue@v2.5.0
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        filename: .github/action-issue-template.md
```

You can see an example of this used in the wild with [this
issue](https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/issues/1476).

::: callout-note
I recommend that you always specify the reason for the failure (and the fix if
it's not a spurious failure as detailed below) when closing the issue. It will
serve as a log and with time, it will help you identify which parts of your
workflows should be improved.
:::

## Re-running workflows manually {#running-workflows-manually}

When your workflows fail, you might want to re-run them. You have two options
here:

-   [re-rerunning the workflow via GitHub dedicated re-run
    feature](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs).
    [Since March 2022, you can even re-run failing jobs
    only](https://github.blog/2022-03-16-save-time-partial-re-runs-github-actions/).
    No need to re-run all jobs every time!

-   adding an extra trigger to be able to start workflows manually in addition
    to the scheduled run:

    ``` yaml
    on:
      workflow_dispatch:
      schedule:
        - cron: "0 12 * * *"
    ```

# Dealing with flaky workflows at the root: possible sources of flakiness and how to fix them

## Failure during initial set up

### R installation

By default, `r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2` [installs R from various sources
depending on the exact version and operating
system](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/cb37ed856450354e2e1d5b4a85275fb8755eff49/setup-r/lib/installer.js#L556-L635):

-   <https://mac.r-project.org/>
-   <https://cloud.r-project.org/>
-   <https://cdn.rstudio.com/>
-   <https://api.r-hub.io/>
-   etc.

Any of these URLs can fail for any reason and cause your R installation, and
therefore your whole action to fail.

It is possible to reduce this possible source of breakage, at the expense of
some flexibility (you cannot install the R version of your choice). Setting the
`install-r` to `false` will use the R version provided in the GitHub Actions
container and not try to install it from external sources:

``` yaml
- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v1
  with:
    install-r: false
```

But this alone is not enough to remove all calls to external resources. Even
when `install-r` is set to `false`, the `setup-r` action checks if the requested
version matches the installed version. And, unless specified otherwise, the R
version requested by default is `'release'`, which means an call to an external
resource (in this case `api.r-hub.io`) is required to convert this version
'number' into an actual number such as R 4.2.0. If you want to avoid all
external calls, you then also have to specify a numeric version number such as:

``` yaml
- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v1
  with:
    install-r: false
    r-version: 4
```

::: callout-note
You can specify a more precise version number but it might be good to only
specify the major version number to limit the breakages due to mismatches during
the requested and available version. R is very stable within major versions so
you're not likely to have failure due to API changes even if you specify the
minor or patch version number.
:::

### R packages installation

R packages installation is a common source of failures. This can be caused by an
incompatibility between package new versions or by intermittent failure while
trying to reach the CRAN-like server.

A good solution to both source of issues if to pin the exact version number and
install/load packages from a local cache. This is easily achieved thanks to the
[renv package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/).

In practice, rather than manually installing package or using the
[`r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies`
action](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/setup-r-dependencies),
you should create a lockfile [^3] and use the [`r-lib/actions/setup-renv`
action](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/setup-renv):

[^3]: You can use renv directly (e.g., by calling `renv::init()`), or other
    derived packages such as [capsule](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/capsule)

``` yaml
- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2
```

## Unaccessible HTTP resources

In addition to the R install & cran-like servers, you might use some internet
resources in your script. And these resources might be unavailable for a number
of reasons. In this case, it is good practice to retry your request. But in a
polite way! The web server might be unavailable because it's already overloaded
with requests. Repeatedly retrying would just make the situation worse in this
case.

The polite way to retry HTTP requests is to use exponential back off. Each time
you one of your request fails, you increase the waiting time until you make a
new one.

Fortunately, you do not have to code the retry feature & the exponential back
off yourself as it is already implemented in common R packages, such as
[httr2](https://httr2.r-lib.org/), via the `req_retry()` function:

```{r, error = TRUE}
library(httr2)

request("https://httpbin.org/status/500") |>
  req_verbose() |>
  req_retry(max_tries = 3) %>%
  req_perform()
```

## `git` repository out of sync

If your workflow takes a long time to run, you might get the following message
when you try to commit your results:

``` html
To https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-forecast-hub-europe !
[rejected] main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-forecast-hub-europe'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do 
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

As helpfully mentioned in the error message, you need to run `git pull ...`
before pushing to make sure your local git copy is up-to-date. However, if you
do this while you have local commits, the default git set-up will create an ugly
merge commit. To avoid the merge commit, instead of running a simple
`git pull ...`, you should run `git pull --rebase ...`. Just note that this will
not save you if you have merge conflicts.

## GitHub itself is out of service

One last option is that GitHub itself, or at least one of its services, is down.
You can check this by visiting the dedicated status page:
<https://www.githubstatus.com/> or even be proactive by subscribing to GitHub
status alerts.

This situation should be exceptional and your best bet is probably to wait until
everything is back to normal and [re-run your failing
workflows](#running-workflows-manually). If the scheduled job is time sensitive,
you can also run it locally.

If this kind of service interruption happens too frequently for your taste but
you still like the GitHub Actions syntax, you might want to try [spinning your
own self-hosted
runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).
