## epiforecasts manual

We are a group of researchers at LSHTM who work on real-time infectious disease modelling, united by shared ways of working: openness, collaborative development and building reusable tools.

We develop, use and critically evaluate computational, statistical and mathematical techniques to improve our understanding of infectious disease outbreaks in real time, often in collaboration with public-health decision makers. We aim to develop general and reusable tools, particularly software packages in widely used, freely and openly available languages, rather than single-use computer code. We value software and tools as research outputs alongside papers, and when writing code for a project, consider whether it could become a reusable package rather than a one-off script.

This document is a point of reference for current and future team members, not a fixed set of rules. Suggestions for changes via Pull Requests are welcome from any group member at any time.

## Group principles

We are aiming to maintain an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and able to ask and answer questions and express new ideas. We recognise that each team member adds value to the group and that people have different skill sets, world views, and approaches to working. We treat each other, as well as our peers outside the group and their work, with respect.

We share work early rather than waiting until it feels ready. Incomplete drafts, failed approaches and dead ends are all worth sharing so that others can help. Our work lives in public GitHub repositories, and we often collaborate through issues and pull requests.

### Expectations from members

Everyone:

* Be passionate and proud about the work you are doing within the group. Do work that others will care about. If you feel as though your work does not meet these standards, we should discuss and try to address this.
* Support the work of other group members and offer help when you feel there is something you can help with.
* Contribute constructively to lab meetings, journal clubs, seminars and other group events.
* Tell someone if you are struggling or if there is a conflict within the group. We can’t thrive in an environment in which we aren’t comfortable.
* Spend your research time on projects related to the aims of the group - you are encouraged to collaborate with people outside the group on other projects, but if these are to take a substantial amount of time this should be discussed first, and as a general rule not cover more than 20% of day-to-day work.
* Take time off at regular intervals, and use the full holiday allowance; also take sick days off if/when needed. We do not glorify workaholic behaviour. There may be times that you have to work longer or harder to finish a time-critical piece of analysis, but this should be balanced out over time.
* Share your work openly and early, in meetings, on GitHub, on Slack. Don't wait until it's polished.
* When someone asks for feedback or help, respond within a few days, even if just to say you can't help right now.
* Engage in ongoing learning and professional development.

PI: All of the above and

* Support you scientifically, emotionally and financially.
* Be available both in person and via electronic communication, including regular meetings to discuss your work and anything else you would like to discuss.
* Provide a broad perspective on your work within the context of the group and the general direction of science.
* Provide timely feedback on drafts of manuscripts, talks, grant proposals, etc.
* Help you identify the next step in your career, whether inside or outside academia, and support you towards it.
* Identify training opportunities and conferences and support you in making the most of them.
* Point out grant and fellowship opportunities to you and support you in applying to appropriate ones.
* Care for your mental and physical well-being, and prioritise it above anything else.
* Model the group's values: share problems and incomplete work openly, ask for help, and show that this is how we work at all levels.

## Publications

### Choice of journal

All our publications must comply with [Wellcome’s Open Access Policy](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/open-access-guidance/open-access-policy). In particular, we will post preprints of any work, and subsequently submit them to a peer-reviewed journal for publication under a CC-BY licence.

We believe that peer review and publication should be open and transparent, and we particularly support journals that allow first submission in any format. We do not design our work to aim for "high-impact" journals but may submit to them if the work is of interest to the broadest readership. We do not mandate any particular policy on journal choice.

Examples of journals that we like are:

* [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/) 
* [F1000 Research](https://f1000research.com/)
* [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/about/author-instructions/)
* [Peer Community In](https://peercommunityin.org)
* [Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index)
* [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/)
* [PLoS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/)
* [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/)


### Authorship

We broadly follow [University of Cambridge Guidelines on Authorship](https://www.research-integrity.admin.cam.ac.uk/research-integrity/guidance/guidelines-authorship). Specifically an author is an individual “judged to have made a substantial intellectual or practical contribution to a publication and who agrees to be accountable for that contribution”. This usually reflects:

1. Making a significant contribution to the conception or design of the project or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND/OR
2. Drafting the work or reviewing/revising it critically for important intellectual content.

We err on the side of inclusion when not sure if someone’s contributions warrant authorship, but don’t award authorship based on friendship, reciprocity or seniority. While authorship does not require writing any of the paper, we will share drafts and submitted version with all coauthors and give opportunities for critical input. If in doubt, we give more time.

For any group publication, group authorship should be agreed based on the value and volume of each person’s contribution, with more supervisory roles towards the end. Where an order between co-authors cannot clearly be resolved we will randomise the order. Everyone should feel encouraged to raise any questions or misgivings they have about authorship on any particular paper.


### Collaborative writing

A paper starts with an outline (e.g., 1 sentence per paragraph) following broadly the structure suggested in [Writing for Impact: How to Prepare a Journal Article](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5854aaa044024321a353bb0d/t/5a14af7271c10b644be97217/1511305075667/WritingForImpact.PDF), that is shared with key collaborators for feedback before engaging in the writing. If writing collaboratively, paragraphs can then be assigned to co-authors. Any finalised paper should be shared with all co-authors at least a week before preprint publication or submission to a journal.


### Code

We use GitHub extensively. Any on-going work should be in an open github repository, unless restrictions on data sharing prevent us from doing so. Collaboration on code should proceed via GitHub Issues or discussions and, upon agreement on the way forward to address the issue, Pull Request (with pushing to main branches directly discouraged unless for very minor commits), which in general should be reviewed by at least one other team member.

The group’s github repository is <https://github.com/epiforecasts>. Initial and exploratory work should be in personal repositories; maturing and collaborative group projects should be in the group repository. Projects that involve multiple repositories and/or include core developers from outside the group can live within separate organisations and mention the affiliation to the group in some other way.

Any publication should be accompanied by a github repository with a README file that allows full reproducibility of the results, reviewed by at least one other team member. Code may either be licensed to the group or licensed to the authors and contributors of that work. We suggest the use of the MIT licence as a default. 


## Meetings

Our meeting structure involves:

### Group meetings (weekly, ~90 minutes)

Weekly group meetings are there to help each other, not to update or impress. Participation is expected of all group members — if you can't make it, send advance notice.

Every group meeting has a rotating chair. The chair is responsible for conducting the meeting in an inclusive manner that gives everyone the chance to contribute.

#### Structure

The meeting starts with the chair briefly sharing something non-work-related — a film, a book, a place visited, something they've been thinking about. The chair then follows up on any commitments from the previous meeting: offers to help, resources to share, introductions to make.

The main part of the meeting consists of three presentation slots of around 20 minutes each:

- **10 minutes:** Presentation following the structure below
- **5 minutes:** Clarifying questions
- **5 minutes:** Silent written feedback in a shared Google Doc (named, to allow follow-up)

#### Presentation structure

1. **"Today I need help with..."** — 1-2 specific problems or questions, not "general feedback"
2. **Your work** (max 8 slides) — focusing on what you're stuck on, thinking about or would like input on
3. **"How you can get involved"** — specific tasks, links, collaboration opportunities
4. **"What you may find useful"** — your expertise, tools or resources relevant to others' work

Before the meeting, the chair and each presenter briefly discuss how the presenter would like to receive feedback and what areas they most want input on.

#### Other meeting types

At longer intervals we use group meetings to:

- Formulate and review broad goals, aims and progress
- Run post-mortems on past projects (what went well, what didn't)
- Update this manual
- Practice talks ahead of conferences — everyone who presents work from the group should have the opportunity to present it to group members for feedback

### Journal club (monthly)

A monthly session to discuss papers, methods or broader topics relevant to the group's work.

### Coffee walks (monthly)

A monthly walk to a coffee shop or similar, replacing a regular meeting. These encourage smaller 2-3 person conversations that don't happen easily in a full group.

### Individual meetings with the PI (every 2 weeks, one hour)

These start with a summary of progress since the last meeting, followed by any points for discussion either of us finds worthy of raising.

We maintain a Google Doc (or similar) for ongoing notes — updated every meeting with a short summary of discussion and action points.

### Subproject meetings (project-dependent frequency)

Where people collaborate on subprojects they are encouraged to agree on a separate meeting schedule to coordinate and update each other on progress.

### Social meetings (whenever we feel like it)

Occasional curry outings etc.

### Feedback

Feedback should be specific, constructive and focused on what the presenter asked for help with. Frame suggestions as curiosity rather than criticism — "I'm curious about..." or "Have you considered..." rather than "Why did you do...?", "You should..." or "I would do...".

## Practicalities

### Communication

We use Slack for most communication within the group. The @epiforecasts channel is for group-internal communication. Email is used for formal communication involving the broader community at LSHTM, and for communicating with people external to the group (except close collaborators, who are invited to Slack).

We acknowledge the potential impact of push notifications on productivity and mental health. Everybody is strongly encouraged to turn off all notifications outside of standard working hours (9am-5pm), and is welcome to regularly check into communication channels rather than being alerted by them when within these hours. Generally, the expectation is that team-internal questions put via Slack are answered within 24 hours. After that, it is not considered impolite to send a reminder.

### Onboarding

When someone new joins the group, they are given an overview of current projects and how they connect, and introduced to relevant tools and communication channels. The group's [projects page](https://epiforecasts.io/projects) provides an overview of current work with links to repositories.

### Web site

The group’s web site is at <https://epiforecasts.io/>. Content can be edited via the github page at <https://github.com/epiforecasts/epiforecasts.github.io> (choose a _.md_ file and edit, or clone the github repo and do it on your own computer). An interesting and up-to-date web site that showcases good work done in the group is of benefit to everyone, but should not take too much of everyone’s time. It is everyone’s responsibility to contribute to this.

### Working hours

One of the benefits of a career in academic research is that it is typically more flexible than other kinds of jobs. However, it is still a job. LSHTM employs people for 35 hours a week, typically expected to happen in 8 hours per weekday with a mandatory 1-hour break. Everybody is strongly encouraged to not work in excess of these hours.

### Presence

There are benefits to working together in the same building, particularly for informal communication. But the same approach does not work for everyone, and we are flexible about whether people work on-site in London or remotely.
