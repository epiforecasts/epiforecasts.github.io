  Seb's main interest is in using computational models in combination with infectious disease data in order to better understand and predict infectious disease dynamics. This includes developing and evaluating methods for short-term forecasting, testing the predictive value of additional data sources on pathogen biology and human behaviour, and doing all of this in order to inform public health decision making. He strongly believes that science should done openly and that there is great value in developing methods as tools that can be used by others.
